# Role-Based Access Control, Explained

The ThousandEyes platform provides a Role-based Access Control \(RBAC\) model for user and user group management.  RBAC provides two principal benefits: First, RBAC eliminates the hierarchical relationships between users, account groups and organizations. Under RBAC, users may belong to more than one Account Group. Second, RBAC provides the flexibility to configure permissions that were previously fixed within the three predefined roles. With RBAC you can create Roles for users which will allow them to do everything which is needed via the UI or API and no more.  

For example, an employee who needs to administer their companyâ€™s ThousandEyes users in multiple accounts was previously required to have the Organization Admin role, which provided permissions not only to administer all users in every account but also permissions to access billing information for all accounts.  Under RBAC, you may assign Roles which have permissions for only user administration tasks in only the Account Groups needed, and not grant permissions for billing or other tasks within those account groups.  
  
For a complete list of all available Permissions, their descriptions and what Permissions are assigned to each of the built-in Roles see the [Roles and permissions table](https://success.thousandeyes.com/Articles?category=User_Management#Permissions-Table).
