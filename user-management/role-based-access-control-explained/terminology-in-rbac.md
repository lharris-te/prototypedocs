# Terminology in RBAC

Account Groups are assigned to Users, who have Roles within each Account Group.  A User can be in one or many Account Groups, and a User can be assigned one of three built-in Roles \(Organization Admin, Account Admin and Regular User\) which have fixed Permissions or a be assigned a custom Role.  Under RBAC, a customer may create multiple new custom Roles and unique permission sets.   
  
**Note: With RBAC, users are associated with the Organization and the Account Admin role does not have permissions required to create, edit or delete users. To provide this capability, a role having the** _**Edit users**_ **permission must be assigned to the user.**
