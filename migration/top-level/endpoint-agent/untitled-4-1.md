## 3. Viewing Data

* Data collected by Endpoint Agents installed within your organization will be available under [Views &gt; Endpoint Data](https://app.thousandeyes.com/view/endpoint-agent/). If you are just starting you will get a message stating that "There are no active monitoring profiles configured. Go to [Endpoint Agent Settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/endpoint/) to create one."
* [Web View](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmpYKAS): Metrics such as number of web pages visited, page success rate, response time and the component-level waterfall view for each webpage are shown.
* [Network View](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmpTKAS): Metrics such as packet loss, latency, jitter and network paths to target web domains are available. This is the default View.
* [Session Details](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmpVKAS): Web and Network Layer data providing details on specific user browsing sessions, gathered from Endpoint Agents.
* [Network Topology](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmpaKAC): Access the layer topologies of Endpoint Agents as connected to their Access Points, Gateways, Proxies or VPNs.

## 4. Working with Endpoint Agent

* Open your Chrome/IE browser and browse web domains configured within your Monitoring Profiles. Endpoint Agent will gather web and network layer data for Monitoring Profiles from within monitored networks under [Views &gt; Endpoint Agents](https://app.thousandeyes.com/view/endpoint-agent/).
* For manual recording of a website, click on the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent browser extension to start recording. Click on it again to stop recording or close browser tab.

## 5. Creating reports

* Go to [Reports &gt; Reports](https://app.thousandeyes.com/reports/) and create a new report by clicking on the ‘Reports’ dropdown and choosing ‘New Blank Report.’
* Provide a report name and hit ‘Enter.’
* Drag the report widgets that you’d like to use into the report, then find the relevant metric you’d like to report on by clicking on the ‘Metric’ dropdown and typing “**endpoint**” to only show Endpoint Agent-related metrics \(if you don’t see any metrics or if there is a limited number of metrics available, the report type you’ve chosen doesn’t support Endpoint Agent metrics\).
