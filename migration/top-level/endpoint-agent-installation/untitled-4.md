# Installing the Endpoint Agent for Windows

The ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent is a browser extension application installed on a user's computer to collect web performance data for websites within configured domains and networks. This document outlines downloading the Endpoint Agent installer file, and installing and enabling the Endpoint Agent for a Windows user.

ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent requires Windows 7 or later, and Google Chrome or Internet Explorer 11+ installed on your machine. Complete operating system and browser support for Endpoint Agent is documented [here](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnBp).

## Distribution of Installers

Endpoint Agent is custom-built for each account. Access to the Endpoint Agent installer from our site requires a ThousandEyes username and password. Customers will need to download the installer file, and distribute it internally to users without a ThousandEyes account. The MSI installer comes in two versions:

* x86 version for 32-bit processors \(but can be used with 64-bit processors\)
* x64 version for 64-bit processors

## Collecting data using the Endpoint Agent

The Endpoint Agent installer is custom-built for each ThousandEyes account, and contains a built-in account key.  This account key is used to route the collected performance data into the right ThousandEyes account.

Two modes of data collection exist:

1. **Automatic data collection:** With the Endpoint Agent installed, if a user browses to a webpage whose domain is configured in a "Monitoring Profile" and the public IP address of the client machine is detected to be inside a "Monitored Network" for that domain, the Endpoint Agent will automatically gather web and network layer data associated with the user's browsing session.
2. **Manual data collection:** A user can initiate data collection by clicking the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent extension button from the browser toolbar. While the Endpoint Agent is recording your browsing session, the top of the page will show a banner indicating that ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent is debugging this tab. To stop recording, simply click the same ThousandEyes extension button in the browser toolbar, or click the Cancel button on the banner.
