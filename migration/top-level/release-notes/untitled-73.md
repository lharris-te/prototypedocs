Now back to your regular Release Notes.

## Agent-to-Agent Tests

We've improved Agent-to-Agent tests by adding support for network address translation \(NAT\) traversal. This will allow Agents running Network/Agent-to-Agent tests to initiate connections to Enterprise Agents behind a NAT'ing firewall without the need for port forwarding rules on the NAT'ing firewall.

To enable NAT traversal for a target Enterprise Agent, click the **Behind a NAT** checkbox on the Agent's settings.  Agents with this setting will run a NAT traversal compatibility check.  If your environment is not compatible with NAT traversal, a warning will be displayed for the Agent on the Enterprise Agents page and under the Agent Status in the [Navigation Bar](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmgKAC).

## Support for Internet Explorer 9 and 10

Since Microsoft has moved Internet Explorer 9 and 10 into "end of support" status \([see this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)\), we are ending support for Internet Explorer versions 9 and 10 in ThousandEyes. Beginning today, if you're using Internet Explorer 9 or 10, you will see a warning when you log in. In a month's time, we will remove the ability to log in using these versions of Internet Explorer.

##  Bugs squashed

The following bugs have been corrected in this week's release

* Customers using authenticated web proxies with the ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance to connect to the Internet were unable to use passwords which included certain special characters. 
* We've added support for both comma \(,\) and semicolon \(;\) as delimiters in the Add User form of the Users tab, on the Account Settings page.
