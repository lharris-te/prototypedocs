# Release Notes 2016-11-09 - ThousandEyes Customer Success Center

Tonight's release night comes on election day, here in the US of A.  Bear with us while we get the bugs out of the system.

Political jokes aside, we've got some promises to deliver on, so without further speeches...

## New Cloud Agent Locations

We're proud to welcome new a Cloud Agent location in the USA in Austin, Texas, two Canadian locations in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Edmonton, Alberta, and an Australian addition in Perth, Western Australia.  A kiss to the new babies.

## â€‹Tests

Back by popular demand: we're reverting our recent color scheme changes to the timeline, with some minor tweaks.  Seems the one-color-fits-all-test-metrics was not polling well with the electorate.

FTP Server tests have had the Target field separated into two fields, one for the server name, and one for path.  This will provide some clarity via differentiation and on-screen help text as to whether to specify an absolute or relative path for your chosen protocol \(FTP, SFTP, FTPS\).  Consult the [Working with Test settings](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000Cmn7KAC) article in the ThousandEyes Knowledge Base for more information.

## Single Sign-On

Single sign-on \(SSO\) metadata can now be downloaded from your identity provider and uploaded into ThousandEyes to configure SSO.  As with voting, we strive for maintaining your privacy and data integrity while improving convenience.

## Alert Rule Notifications

Alert Rule notifications sent to the Slack messaging application can now use the @user syntax to call a user's attention to the message.  Simply use the "@user" syntax in the **Channel** field of your Slack Alert Notification, just as you would use "\#channel"  Get your Slack [@users](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201259356-Slash-commands) out to vote at a Slack [/poll](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/229002507-Polls-in-Slack).
