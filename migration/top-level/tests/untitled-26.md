# Using the Voice Call view

A Voice Call test is comprised of a SIP Server test and an RTP Stream test. When you create a Voice Call test, you get access to the SIP Server and RTP Stream views which leverage the [ThousandEyes standard layout](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmgKAC).
