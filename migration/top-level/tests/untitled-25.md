# Cloud Agent with Local Problems

When a Cloud Agent experiences full or partial loss of network connectivity or other problems affecting the Agent's ability to perform tests, the Agent is marked with a "Local Problems" error message on the test results page. Typically, such problems occur due to provider issues, such as server or network hardware failures, or network errors such as routing or other configuration errors.

On the Timeline, a grey bar indicates the rounds when the test used one or more Cloud Agents with a local problem \(see the red box in the screenshot below\). Hovering over the bar will display a tooltip, indicating which Agent\(s\) are affected. Additionally, the "Local Problems" error message appears in tooltips when hovering over the Agent name in the Tables tab or hovering over the Agent icon in the Path Visualization.
