# Release Notes: 2017-05-24

Summer's just around the corner, along with some big changes for our product and big benefits for our customers.  Until then, a mild spring release night, tonight.  Here's the details...  
  
Network World recently [published a version](http://www.networkworld.com/article/3194890/internet/comparing-the-performance-of-popular-public-dns-providers.html) of a blog post by ThousandEyes' Product Marketing Manager, Young Xu.  [Entitled 2017 Update: Comparing the Performance of Popular Public DNS Providers](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/comparing-performance-popular-public-dns-providers-2017/), the blog post provides updated data from [the first blog post](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/comparing-latency-top-public-dns-providers/) on this topic by Microsoft's Mehmet Akcin, published in 2015.  Read one, read them all. 

## Bug fixes & minor features

Here's the bux fixes and minor features in this week's release:

* The API now provides access to the Utilization statistic for Agent Clusters, in addition to Utilization for individual Enterprise Agents.
* An API request to create a Network test previously ignored incorrect "Protocol" field specifications and created a test with default values.  The API now correctly validates the Protocol field.
* Fixed a bug that prevented an Enterprise Agent with high utilization from being removed from an Agent to Agent test.
* Fixed a bug that prevented saving changes to test settings and generated an "Unable to process your request. Please try again later" error message.
* The Reports Snapshots page of an Account Group that has no snapshots displays a link to the Reports view which was pointing to the wrong page.  The link now points to the correct Reports page.
* When using the Duplicate function on a Report, the resulting copy is no longer itself duplicated.
* Fixed a BrowserBot issue that was generating a "Browser didn't initialize correctly" error.
* Fixed an issue with web pages that caused BrowserBot crashes and showed a timeout in waterfall data, but still produced screenshots.
