* Angelique Medina, Director of Product Marketing at ThousandEyes, reviews the most disruptive Internet outages of 2019, outlines what you can learn from them, and explains how Internet Insights can help in the future, with their newest blog post, [Looking Back at the Biggest Internet Outages of 2019](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/looking-back-biggest-internet-outages-2019/).
* In their post, [Monitoring Application Performance with Elastic APM](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/monitoring-application-performance-elastic-apm/), Sergio Freitas \(Engineering Manager at ThousandEyes\) dives into the reasons behind adopting an Application Performance Management \(APM\) tool, why we chose Elastic APM, and how it was deployed and integrated with the rest of our infrastructure.
