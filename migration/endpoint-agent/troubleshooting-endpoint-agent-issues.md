# Troubleshooting Endpoint Agent issues

In the event that the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent does not install or function correctly, review the following information:

## Endpoint Agent installed on Windows

### ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent button is missing from Chrome

1. First, verify that the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent is installed on your system. Go to **Add/Remove Programs** and scroll down to the entry for `ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent`. If the package is not installed, contact your system administrator, or follow the instructions for [installing the Endpoint Agent on Windows](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnBuCAK_Installing-the-Endpoint-Agent-for-Windows).
2. If the package is installed, open the Chrome extensions page by going to **Tools &gt; Extensions**. Find the `ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent` in the list, and ensure that it is enabled.
3. If the package is installed but the extension is missing, browse to [https://app.thousandeyes.com/install/endpoint-agent](https://app.thousandeyes.com/install/endpoint-agent). This will allow you to add the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent to Google Chrome.

### Start/Stop Recording is missing from Internet Explorer

1. First, check to ensure that you are running a compatible version of Internet Explorer. We currently support Internet Explorer version 11 and higher on Windows 7, Windows 8.x, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012. For versions of Windows which ship with the Metro UI, we only support the use of the Endpoint Agent in Desktop mode.
2. Next, make sure the Endpoint Agent is installed on your system. Go to **Add/Remove Programs**, and scroll down to the entry for `ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent`. If the package is not installed, contact your system administrator, or follow the instructions for [installing the Endpoint Agent on Windows](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnBuCAK_Installing-the-Endpoint-Agent-for-Windows).
3. If the package is installed, try restarting Internet Explorer. If Internet Explorer hasn't been restarted since the package was installed, then the application won't have hooks into IE.
4. After you've restarted Internet Explorer, if the plugin is still missing, go to **Tools &gt; Manage add-ons**:
   1. Under the **Add-on Types** menu, select **Toolbars and Extensions**.
   2. Find the item with the name **Start/Stop Recording** and check the status to ensure that it is enabled.
