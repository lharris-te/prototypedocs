# Endpoint Agent End-user Experience

This article addresses the effects of installing Endpoint Agent from the end-user perspective.  You may also be interested in the [ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent End-User FAQ](https://www.thousandeyes.com/product/endpoint-agents/end-user-faq), a publicly available webpage on the ThousandEyes site which can be used to answer some common questions that your users might have.

In general, end users will not see any degradation of system or network performance as a result of the Endpoint Agent. A button to start or stop manual recording of an Endpoint Agent session will appear in the user's browser and the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent will be listed in the browser's installed extensions/plug-ins.  Additionally, the Endpoint Agent will run a small number of processes that will be visible in a process listing.  The details of these changes depend on the operating system and browser, and are listed below.

## **Windows**

### Browser Plug-in

 When recording browser activity manually, users will see a popup window bar that says “Recording Started.” The popup will disappear when users click the same button to stop recording, or if the user closes the browser tab.

* **Chrome**:
* ​​**Internet Explorer:**

### Processes

* te-agent  The system service responsible for gathering system and network data, receiving new configurations, and sending data back to ThousandEyes. Runs in the SYSTEM context.
* te-browserhelper  The process that accepts performance data from the browser plug-ins and forwards the data to te-agent. Runs in the user context.
* te-updater  The process responsible for checking for and installing updates. Runs in the user context to download updates, and in the SYSTEM context to install updates.
* te-proxy  This process is run only if a browser proxy configuration is used and available in the user context, and is not available to the system service \(running in SYSTEM context\). te-proxy runs in the user context and bridges contexts so that te-agent and te-updater can communicate over the network with ThousandEyes through the configured browser proxy.
