# How to configure Single Sign-On with Google G Suite

### How to configure Single Sign-On with Google G Suite

For the security of your SaaS-based infrastructure and the convenience of users in your organization, the ThousandEyes service offers login via single sign-on \(SSO\). ThousandEyes supports SAML2-based identity providers \(IdPs\) for single sign-on.  In this configuration example, we use Google's G Suite \(formerly Google Apps\) as the identity provider.

There are **two steps** to set up single sign-on:

1. Identity provider configuration, which is done within your identity provider's system \(in this case, Google\)
2. Service provider configuration, which is done within ThousandEyes using one of the following options:

* [Static Configuration]() : requires manual settings of the parameters.
* [Imported Metadata Configuration]() : a metadata file is used to configure the parameters \(recommended method\).
* [Dynamic Configuration]() : a URL is used to configure the parameters \(not yet supported by G Suite SAML\)

## Prerequisites 

Here's what you need to configure single sign-on:

* User in a role with the Edit security & authentication settings permission in ThousandEyes.
* A G Suite administrator account.

## Identity provider \(Google\) configuration  

1. Log in to G Suite using an administrator account
2. Open the Admin Console \([https://admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/)\)
3. Click on the **Apps \(Manage apps and their settings\)** item 
4. Click on the **SAML apps**
5. Click on the **+** icon to configure a new SAML application
6. Click on **SETUP MY OWN CUSTOM APP**
7. Obtain the Google identity provider information for configuration in ThousandEyes.

    "**Option 1**" is used for [Static Configuration]() of the Service Provider. Copy and paste the SSO URL and IdP Entity ID values into a separate document, and download the certificate. Then click **Next.** Or...

    "**Option 2**" is used for [Imported Metadata Configuration]() of the Service Provider. Download the IDP Metadata file. Then click **Next.**

Enable the ThousandEyes application for all users by clicking on the More Options menu \(three vertical dots\) and selecting **ON for everyone**

## Returing to standard \(non-SSO\) login page

If your organization discontinues use of SSO at any time, you can return to the login page, by using this special login:

[https://app.thousandeyes.com/login?breakSso](https://app.thousandeyes.com/login?breakSso)

This will return you to the normal, non-SSO login page.  
 

## Required Permissions

The following information describes the permissions required in ThousandEyes in order to configure or use single sign-on.  For more information on configuring roles and permissions, see the ThousandEyes Knowledge Base article [Role-Based Access Control explained](https://success.thousandeyes.com/ViewArticle?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnLKAS).

### Configuration

In order to configure single sign-on in ThousandEyes, a user in a role with the Edit security & authentication settings permission is required, as described above.

### User permissions

For a user to login using single sign-on, they must be assigned a role with the Login via Single Sign-On permission.  To restrict users to login only via SSO, remove the Login via ThousandEyes login page permission. Note that for users with management permissions, it is not possible to remove the Login via ThousandEyes login page permission. This feature ensures administrators cannot be prevented from logging in when having issues with an identity provider.
