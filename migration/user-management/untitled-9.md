# How to Configure SCIM with Okta

### How to Configure SCIM with Okta

ThousandEyes users can be added, deleted and modified using SCIM 2.0 and 1.1 compatible identity providers, dramatically decreasing time to provision users into ThousandEyes. This document describes the integration between identity provider Okta and ThousandEyes.

This integration has been fully tested by Okta and ThousandEyes but it's currently not available for all Okta organizations. If you wish to try user provisioning on ThousandEyes through Okta, please reach us at support@thousandeyes.com.

### [Prerequisites]()

 To perform configuration in ThousandEyes,  a user having a role with the following permissions is required:

* View Users
* Edit Users
* API Access

### [Supported Features]()

* User provisioning \(creation\)
* User deletion
* User modification
  * Display name

 Group information or other user attributes cannot be translated into Account Groups, Roles or any other ThousandEyes structure.

### [Configuration]()

If the user doesn’t exist, it will be created in ThousandEyes and no registration or activation will be required from the newly created user.

Within ThousandEyes, the user should be visible shortly after it was associated with the service from Okta. To validate this, go to the Users section within Account Settings and verify the newly added user is present there:
