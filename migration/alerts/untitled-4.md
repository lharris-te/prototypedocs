# Alert Suppression Windows - ThousandEyes Customer Success Center

The ThousandEyes platform provides Alert Suppression Windows to suppress alerting for Tests during the periods such as planned maintenance.  Windows can be one-time events or recurring events to handle periodic occurrences such as monthly downtime for maintenance.

The Alert Suppression Window will be displayed as a blue bar on the timeline of any test to which the Alert Suppression Window is assigned. Mousing over the bar displays the description:

## Effects on Alerts and Notifications

During an Alert Suppression Window, data from tests assigned to the Window is not evaluated against Alert Rule criteria. Data that meets alerting conditions will not trigger an alert until the Alert Suppression Window has ended. Notifications \(such as emails, Webhooks or PagerDuty integrations\) which would normally occur will not occur during the Window.  However, be aware of the following edge cases:

* If an Alert Rule's criteria require two or more rounds in a row to trigger, then no rounds within the Window can contribute to the consecutive rounds.
* If an Alert Rule's criteria require two or more Agents in the same round to trigger, it is possible for the Alert Suppression Window to start or end at a time within a round of data when some Agents running the test have gathered data but others have not.  As a result, conditions that would normally trigger an Alert Rule do not trigger the Alert Rule at the edge of the Window.  An example when this may happen is an Alert Suppression Window whose start or finish time ends in '5', and the Alert Suppression Window is assigned to tests which run at 2-minute intervals.  The Alert Suppression Window may start before or end after only some of the Agents have collected data.  Those Agents which have not collected data will not contribute to Alert Rule evaluation.
* If an Alert Rule is active at the beginning of an Alert Suppression Window, the Alert is not cleared once the Alert Suppression Window begins.  Since no data is evaluated for alerts during the Alert Suppresion Window, the alert cannot be cleared until the Alert Suppression Window has ended, and data gathered which does not meet the Alert Rule criteria.

**IMPORTANT: ThousandEyes platform runs on Universal Coordinated Time \(UTC\).  Because UTC does not experience a period of Daylight Savings Time, the Alert Suppression Windows do not take into account Daylight Savings Time.  If an Alert Suppression Window is scheduled prior to the beginning or end of Daylight Savings Time to run at a time after the change in Daylight Savings Time, the Window will be off by the amount of the time shift.  Please check your scheduled Alert Suppression Windows prior to the beginning or end of Daylight Savings Time and make any necessary adjustments.**

Only tests to which an Alert Suppression Window is assigned are affected by an Alert Suppression Window. Other tests are not affected.  Also, Notifications for non-test related events such Enterprise Agents going offline or online are not affected by an Alert Suppression Window.
