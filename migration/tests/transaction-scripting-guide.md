# Transaction Scripting Guide

Welcome to the ThousandEyes Transaction Scripting Guide, a series of resources about a test type called **Transaction**. In short, transaction tests mimic user journeys through web applications, enabling you to make sure those journeys complete successfully and provide an insight into the user experience.

**NOTICE:** This guide focuses on the [new generation transactions](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/introducing-internet-aware-synthetic-transaction-monitoring/).
